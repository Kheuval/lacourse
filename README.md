# La Course

A mobile app built with Vue.js 3, Typescript, TailwindCSS and Capacitor available [on the play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=shop.lacourse.twa) (android only).

Since the app is not well referenced on the play store, you may have a hard time finding it using regular search on your mobile device.

You can, however find it directly by typing `pname:shop.lacourse.twa` in the play store search bar.

## To set up the project locally

### Install dependencies :

```sh
npm install
```

### In the `.env` file set the `APP_API_URL` as follows :

```sh
APP_API_URL="https://lacourse.alwaysdata.net"
```

### Start the dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

You can now create an account and browse the app.

You can run tests with :

```sh
npm run test
```
